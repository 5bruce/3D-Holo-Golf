In this scene, my plan is to try to build the basic framework of the open HoloAcademy240 tutorial,
but instead using as much of the HoloToolkit as possible, rather than their AcademyHoloToolkit library.
From there, I will try to build in the functionality specific to 3dHoloPong.
Thus, the resulting sharing scene will not be following the expected way that the 
HoloToolkit expects, but it will (ideally) get the job of sharing done; can think about converting 
to expected method later.
